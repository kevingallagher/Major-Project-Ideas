## Greener initiative app (working name)
 
## Overview

Its time for us all to take some initiative and help clean up our planet. Some of you my be aware of The North Atlantic Garbage Patch. The patch is twice the size of Texas and can be 9 foot in depth. Made up all man made plastics that have found their way into steams and rivers. If you haven’t already take some time to watch BBCs Blue Planet II, please do.
So now we all know that a our planet is overflowing with our man made plastics. What do we do?

This app is an environmental clean up initiative. Inspired by a few hashtags I’ve seen on Twitter and Instagram. #beachcleanup and #3pop (3 pieces of plastic).

The app would notify users to mindful and aware of the rubbish we tread on and pass by on our streets daily.
Tasks can be set of daily or weekly challenges. 
The daily reminders will task you to do your part and pick up a number from 1 and 5 pieces of plastic and to dispose of them correctly. With daily rewards and badges with consecutive streak. Or you can try our weekly challenges to go a full week with out making any plastic waste then share your experience with the community!

This app will serve as a hub for a community green awareness. Interact and meet with fellow green doers. There would be community days where individuals can gather in a certain places to help clean up a stream, park or beach.

## Route : a Running/jogging route planning App

## Overview

This year I tasked myself with a new years resolution of starting to move more. After a couple months of struggling at the gym I found running was my go to for cardio training. Taking that next step away from trusty treadmill where i had control over my speed, pace, gradient and time, was a little unnerving. If i was going to take part in a half marathon I needed to step outside and outside of my comfort zone. 
I downloaded a few running apps to help with adjustment, Mapmyrun and Strava. As someone that likes to plan ahead their runs, I found it hard to invasion a route that was a certain amount of kilometres. Or how difficult or hilly the route would be I if was looking to distance train. 

The idea for “Route” would be an app that produces routes for running. Whatever distance or difficulty you aiming for based on location. You may want 5k with some hills, or a flat 10k, this app with use your location at the time or a pre-set starting point, to map out your preferred route.

* Plans routes simply
* Ajustable difficulites
* Great for beginner runners

**Con**

* A lot of competition with other fitness apps

Prototyped in Invision and after effects
