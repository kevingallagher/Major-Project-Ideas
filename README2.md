## Title: /* Paint me Beautiful Instagram */

## Research Question: /* Social media pressures causeing us anxiety and depression? */


## Introduction

In this essay, my goal is to research how social media has been affecting our mental health and behaviour. In doing this I hope to learn who is most vulnerable to the anxieties of modern social media. Are young people most effectedWhat makes these people be more vulnerable? Is it the social media or the tech habits that are the cause? Ultimately I want to research how we can move forward, with this new knowledge, to thrive alongside technology.


## Section 1: /* Who is affected? */

The purpose of this section is to highlight the size of the problem. 
I want to research the ages of people that are suffering from anxiety and depression. If there are this could maybe be an indication that advancing technology could be having a negative effect on mental health on a broad scope.
Following this, I think it would be interesting to see the statistics for the number of people, and their ages, that have social media acconts right now and over the last 10 years.
Finally, I want to see the statistics for the ages of users and time spent across different social media platforms. Through doing this I would be interested to see the weather time spent on social media reflected negative effects on mental health issues.
Ultimately this section would inform who is most affected with depression and anxiety. It will answer if technology and social media usage show a trend that could be correlated with those affected.


## Section 2: /* Exploring the Fiction? */

In this section, I want to get into whysocial media is changing our behaviours and causing serious harm to some of its user mental and sometimes physical health. 
The first thing I will be looking into is the pressures set on the social media users to be liked and followed. Is this pressure too much for younger users? Is this competition to get more likes than a friend or more than a previous post, building our self-esteem or damaging it?
<!--
live a good rounded healthy lifestyle consisting of, a good diet, meaningful social experiences, and exercise. All these factors may lead a person to become anxious and depressed over time if not dealt with.-->


## Section 3: /* Where Do We Go From Here? */

This section I will be looking at what is out there now to help those whose mental health has been negatively affected by technology and social media.

Just this year Apple has come out with screen time in iOS 12. Apple screen time serves as a data collector for how we spend our precious time on our Apple devices. It also has a feature where you can limit the amount of time you spend on apps and at what time of day you are unable to use certain apps past. I feel like this is a good place to begin and a way of keeping on track with a healthy amount of time spent on social media.

I would like to research how social media platforms are tackling cyberbullying. I may follow a famous case study into bullying on twitter and follow up on how it was handled. Researching a case study may help to ensure that social media platforms are following up with penalties to bullying.  


### Conclusion

I think we all can agree that we have felt the pressures to put your ‘best self’ on social media and that this could be a factor in increasing rates of anxiety and depression. However, I hope that through this essay we can explore the benefits of social media that exist too. I hope to share the importance of balance and all things in moderation as we move into a world ever crowded with technology, so as to live healthily and thrive.
